# FragFile
FragFile is a Python-based utility meticulously crafted to bolster data security by dispersing files across multiple locations or storage devices. Empowering users to partition files into discrete segments, termed as Primary Crypted Files (Primary.fesf) and Secondary Crypted Files (Secondary.fesf), FragFile ensures secure storage in distinct locations. This strategic fragmentation not only enhances data redundancy but also fortifies the safeguarding of vital information against potential loss or unwarranted access.

Key Features:

File Fragmentation: Seamlessly slice files into encrypted segments, facilitating distribution across various storage devices, locations, or cloud services.

Data Redundancy: Elevate data redundancy by storing identical file segments in multiple secure havens, mitigating the perils of data loss.

File Restoration: Effortlessly merge Primary.fesf and Secondary.fesf files back into their pristine form, empowering users to restore data from dispersed storage repositories.

Configuration Repository: Preserve critical data like the original file name, extension, and segment size in a configuration file, ensuring swift and accurate file reconstruction.

Data Fortification: Employ encryption to shield file segments, upholding data confidentiality and security throughout the distribution and storage continuum.

Cross-Platform Compatibility: Crafted in Python, FragFile seamlessly operates across diverse platforms, delivering flexibility and accessibility.

Use Cases:

Data Backup: Effectively disseminate crucial data across multiple secure locations, guarding against potential data loss arising from hardware failure or unforeseen contingencies.

Data Redundancy: Bolster data integrity and availability by deploying FragFile to store file segments across a spectrum of storage media.

Data Recovery: Seamlessly reunite segmented files to retrieve data from securely dispersed locations in scenarios involving data loss or system failures.

FragFile stands as a formidable solution, elevating data security and redundancy through meticulous file dispersion across diverse locations and storage mediums. Whether you seek to fortify critical data or ensure swift data recovery, FragFile streamlines the process, emerging as an invaluable asset for data security and preservation.
